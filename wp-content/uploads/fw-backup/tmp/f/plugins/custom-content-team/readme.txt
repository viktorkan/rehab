A complete team solution for creative people.

== Description ==

Custom Content Team is a team management plugin for creative people such as artists, photographers, and Web designers to showcase their work.  Just like what bbPress is doing for forums and BuddyPress is doing for social networks, Custom Content Team is doing for teams.

This plugin was created because of the rising need from users who are downloading WordPress themes with team management built in (not a good idea for content portability).  I wanted users to be able to switch themes without losing their content.  This will also allow any theme developer to build a theme on top of this plugin.
